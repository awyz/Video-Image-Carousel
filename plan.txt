Steps

Creation
* Create window with a div in it (set width & height)
* Enable controls
* Make background black
* set loadTimer for pictures & fade count

currently uses bigList to switch through images

idea
* put videos file name inside of bigList
* randomly choose something in big list
* if filename ends with .mp4, then show video layer and hide img layer
  * ignore loadTimer
  * put video on video layer and play
  * once it is done, hide the video layer
* if file is an image, show image layer and hide video layer
  * use loadTimer
  * show for loadTimer amt of seconds
  * once done, hide image layer
* randomly choose something in the big list again

problem:
* images and videos are in different directories
* can we just make the image path normal and video path ../videos

adding to carousel
* same eat function as image

 movie_player for findAllApplicationsOfType

 click on videos that dont play

 onended event video

 resize --> use this.sendResize!!!

 Q: What does initApp do?

 imageLoadCallback --> mediaLoadCallback
